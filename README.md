This website was created for The Monkees. The band requested a website that 
would showcase videos, photos, music and also offer the chance to be able to book 
them to perform at events. I have fufilled each need the band requested, and have
made sure that each different request was easily showcased on my website.

To create my navigation bar I used Bootstrap, when first creating the Navigation bar
my idea was to have a dropdown menu for the media as I wanted it grouped together, 
however after trying and testing the code I found that it wasn't going to work - 
especially when I was making my nav bar mobile responsive. I ran into a few issues when 
setting the background picture. At first I was having trouble finding a picture that was large enough 
to not pixalise on large desktop screens, but also not over run or be squished together
when on a mobile screen. I then searched to see if there was a way of setting pictures depending on
the size of the screen, hence the change in picture when viewing on a mobile screen. My
footer was fairly easy to create, however I wanted the social media icons to move when hoovering,
so I used the SHAKE keyframe to make them wiggle.

When creating my photo page I had an issue when trying to place the pictures the way 
I wanted them. At first I tried a responsive image grid but found the images didn't place well when on large
desktop screens and on small mobile screens. I then decided to use a table and place the images 
inside as I felt this would get me the layout I want and would keep the page looking neat. I then used 
@media screen to make the table mobile responsive.

To create my video page, I used HTML5 code. I wanted my video to be placed in the center 
of my web page, however in the future I would possible advised against as it can look and
fit weird depending on the size of the screen.

A main issue I found was during the creation my audio page, I used the new HTML5 audio
code and found it was incredibly difficult to make the page eye catching due to the
lack of styling that can be done to the code. 

Finally, my events page uses bootstrap. I used bootstrap as I found it was the easiest way,
and it also meant I could apply my CSS code to it easier. I would like to make it more eye
catching in the future.
